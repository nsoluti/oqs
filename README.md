# OQS Ontology

The **OQS (Ontology for Questionnaires and Scales)** aims to provide a structured, formal, and reusable representation of concepts related to questionnaires, measurement scales, variables, and their metadata.

## Access to the Ontology

The ontology is available in two ways:
- By accessing the file [`oqs.ttl`](./oqs.ttl) directly.
- Through the persistent URI: [http://purl.org/nsoluti/oqs](http://purl.org/nsoluti/oqs).

## Use Cases and Validation

The file [`casodeuso.ttl`](./casodeuso.ttl) contains a set of use cases that were used to validate the conceptual coverage and consistency of the OQS ontology. Each use case models a typical application scenario for questionnaires and their associated elements.

## SPARQL Queries and Results

The file [`qc.doc`](./qc.doc) presents the SPARQL queries and their corresponding results for each of the use cases. These queries demonstrate how the ontology can be queried to retrieve and validate the modeled information.

## Ontology Documentation

The complete documentation of the ontology, including detailed conceptual models, meta-properties, and usage guidelines, is available at:
