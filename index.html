	Line 15:     dct:description "The FAIR Model Catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Research, short-named OntoUML/UFO Catalog, is a structured and open-source catalog that contains OntoUML and UFO ontology models. It was designed to support empirical research in OntoUML and UFO, as well as for the general conceptual modeling area, by providing high-quality curated, structured, and machine-processable data on why, where, and how different modeling approaches are used. The catalog offers a diverse collection of models, created by modelers with varying modeling skills, for a range of domains, and for different purposes. The models are available in machine-readable formats (JSON and Turtle) and are accessible via permanent identifiers."@en ;

It is in the same way that every utterance that appropriately designates a simple concept by convention [ex institutione] is said to be incomplex, [precisely] because it is subordinated in order to designate a simple concept. That is to say, just because some spoken or written sign has some sort of recognizable complexity (as even single words consist of syllables, and those of sounds or letters), one must not assume that the corresponding concept has some corresponding complexity. Indeed, it happens even in ordinary usage that an originally complex phrase is transferred to designate a simple concept. This is the case, for example, with the phrase “man’s best friend” in English, which, at least according to one of its uses, is transferred to designate the same concept that is designated by the simple word “dog,” which, as we can assume with Buridan, is a simple concept.” (Klima)",

[�] For example, the term-negation �non� in the term �nonhuman� does not signify anything in extramental reality, for there is no such a thing as a negation in re existing on a par with humans, beasts, plants, and rocks. However, this does not mean that this word does not signify at all. For even if it does not signify something, it does signify somehow: even if it does not signify a negation in re, it does signify negatively, namely, by negating the significata of the categorematic term with which it is construed, so that the resulting complex term supposits in a proposition for what is not signified by the negated categorematic term. [�] syncategorematic terms can have material supposition (thus the term �non� in �Non est negatio� can be taken to stand materiallyfor its immediate signifi cata, the token concepts of negation in individual human minds or itself and other tokens of the same type).� (Klima)"@en;

	Line 9: 	abstract     = {Companies face the challenge of managing customer relationships (CRM) in a context marked by a drastic digital transformation and unbridled evolution of consumer behavior, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The customer is more demanding, has access to the global market and interacts with companies through multiple digital channels, such as email, social networks, mobile apps or instant messaging. In this situation, the success of a CRM implementation highly depends on information technology and the applications used. To harmonize this new business context with the development of information systems (IS), a suitable CRM ontology and enterprise architecture (EA) is needed. While an ontology-based conceptual model provides a unifying framework, aids sharing and reusing knowledge, and facilitates communication within a domain, an EA-based model unequivocally describes, analyzes, and visualizes how an organization should operate from the perspective of business, application, and technology. The purpose of the paper is the proposal of CURIE-O, a CRM OntoUML UFO-based ontology, together with CURIE-EA, a CRM ArchiMate-based EA to serve business managers and IS specialists an updated unifying framework of reference in the CRM domain as well as a highly efficient tool to support application development and maintenance in this changing and increasingly digital context. Modeling has proven to be an essential element to achieve high-performance information systems. In order to apply the ontology and the EA proposed here, the authors developed a CRM task management application prototype that was implemented as a case study in a consulting company. The methodology followed was design science research (DSR), in order to design and validate the artifacts. Within the DSR framework, other complementary research methods have been used, in particular literature research, interviews and focus groups carried out with several hotel chains in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The main existing CRM models in  ...

To play their role as instruments for domain modeling, conceptual models must contain the exact set of constraints that represent the worldview of the relevant domain stakeholders. However, as empirical results show, conceptual modelers are subject to cognitive limitations and biases and, hence, in practice, they systematically produce models that fall short in that respect. Moreover, automating the process of formally assessing conceptual models in this sense (i.e., model validation) is notoriously hard, mainly because the intended worldview at hand lies in the mind of these stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to model validation and automated constraint learning that combines, on one hand, Model Finding via the visual simulation of that model's valid instances and, on the other hand, Inductive Logic Programming techniques. In our approach, we properly channel the results produced by the application of a visual model finding technique as input to a learning process. We then show how the approach is able to support the modeler in identifying missing constraints from the original model. The approach is validated against a catalog of empirically-elicited conceptual modeling anti-patterns. As we show here, the approach is able to support the automated learning of constraints that are needed to rectify a number of relevant anti-patterns in this catalog.}

	Line 31: 	abstract     = {Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) is a systematic approach to analyze potential disasters and reduce their occurrence rate and possible impact. The main DRR component is an Early Warning System (EWS), which is a distributed information system that is able to monitor the physical world and issue warnings if abnormal situations occur. EWSs that use Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, so called IoT EWS, are suitable to realize (near) real-time data acquisition, risk detection and message brokering between data sources and information receivers, comprising both humans (e.g., emergency managers) and machines (e.g., sirens).Over the last years, numerous IoT EWSs were developed to monitor different types of hazards. Multi-hazard EWSs are a special class of EWS that can detect different types of situations and, if necessary, react to them. Multi-hazard EWSs require integration of existing EWSs and seamless integration with new EWSs. Interoperability of EWS components is necessary for effective integration, e.g., so that sensors, devices and platforms work with each other and with other EWSs.Although IoT technologies offer possibilities to improve the EWS efficiency and effectiveness, this potential can only be exploited if interoperability challenges are addressed at all levels. In this thesis, we focus on how to improve the semantic interoperability of IoT EWSs. Semantic interoperability refers to the ability of two or more EWSs (or EWS components) to share data elements in a prescribed format (syntax) and precise unambiguous meaning (semantics). From a literature review on semantic IoT EWS approaches, we selected the three major challenges that need to be addressed together:1) semantic integration of a variety of data sources that make use of different standards, ontologies and data models;2) near-real-time processing in time- and safety-critical applications; and3) data analysis for effective situation awareness and decision support.This thesis introduces the ``SEmantic Model-driven de ...

	Line 12:   abstract = {The concept of “service” has been characterized in different disciplines and by different authors from various points of view. This variety of characterizations has emerged because although this notion seems intuitive, it is far from trivial, with many interrelated perspectives. Given their importance in enterprise computing and Service Science in general, we believe that a clear account of services and service-related concepts is necessary and would serve as a basis for communication, consensus and alignment among approaches and perspectives. In this paper we propose a commitment-based account of the notion of service captured in a core reference ontology called UFO-S. We address the commitments established between service providers and customers, and show how such commitments affect the service lifecycle. Moreover, we show that the commitment-based account can serve to harmonize different notions of service in the literature.}

So the unjust person fails to be moderate, or fails to be wise, or fails to be courageous. Actually, the relation among the virtues seems tighter than that, for it seems that the unjust person necessarily fails to be wise, courageous, and temperate... You might try to deny this. You might say that a person could be courageous—with spirited attitudes that track perfectly what the rational attitudes say is fearsome and not, in the face of any pleasures and pains—but still be unjust insofar has her rational attitudes are inadequately developed, failing to know what really is fearsome. But Socrates seems to balk at this possibility by contrasting the civically courageous whose spirit preserves law-inculcated beliefs about what is fearsome and not and the genuinely courageous in whom, presumably, spirit preserves knowledge about what is fearsome and not. So you might say instead that a person could be moderate—utterly without appetitive attitudes at odds with what his rational attitudes say is good for him—but still be unjust insofar as his rational attitudes are inadequately developed and fail to know what really is good. But this picture of a meek, but moderate soul seems to sell short the requirements of moderation, which are not merely that there be no insurrections in the soul but also that there be agreement that the rational attitudes should rule.

Indeed, this notion of parts is robust enough to make one wonder why reason, spirit, and appetite are parts at all, as opposed to three independent subjects. But the Republic proceeds as though every embodied human being has just one soul that comprises three parts. No embodied soul is perfectly unified: even the virtuous person, who makes her soul into a unity as much as she can, has three parts in her soul. (She must, as we shall see, in order to be just.)

According to [Porello and Guizzardi 2018], this binary case may be extrapolated to include other VALUE BEARERS, each one associated to its own value. Here, VALUE itself is an emerging quality inhering in a VALUE ASCRIPTION that takes a magnitude in a given conceptual space (termed a VALUE MAGNITUDE SPACE [Porello and Guizzardi 2018] and not shown in the picture7).

It provides, therefore, a new infrastructure where programs and devices can exchange information in an intelligent and automated way, producing a ``Web of Knowledge''. The Semantic Web has produced sophisticated services, with applicability in several areas. Notably, the rapid pace of organizational changes in public administration, the legal harmonization, the need to formalize and automate processes that involve a lawsuit, and the considerable increase in the legal corpus have attracted attention to the representation of Legal Knowledge, as well as the creation of systems that can reason in this field. This thesis, therefore, analyzes the nuances at the ontological level to formalize Brazilian Legal and Normative Knowledge, exploring an area known as Legal Computing. In the scope of Brazilian legislation, however, we can highlight semantic problems of linguistic as well as conceptual type. For the former case, the inherent ambiguity of natural language has led to the production of documents subject to multiple interpretations. In addition, the rhetorical and fancy language commonly used in law has led to the sub-specification of rules and concepts and, consequently, to inconsistencies, inaccurate modeling, and disagreements. This project aims, based on Semantic Web standards (the Description Logic formalism (DL) and the Ontology Web Language (OWL)), to define an ontological approach to model a portion of the Brazilian Criminal Law, in particular, the General Theory of Crime. Thus, it is possible to build systems based on legal-normative knowledge, capable of reasoning and supporting decision-making, mitigating potential syntactic and semantic anomalies.

Furthermore, it deals with the creation and application of procedures for the management and administration of this data. The thesis uses the OntoUML notation to create and maintain the domain and the Neo4j graph database together with the MySQL relational database for data storage. The work's original proposal is design of the transformation process of OntoUML schema into the Neo4j graph database.}

However, not much has been written yet on the ontological status of artefacts or their structure. After March {\&} Smith's (1995) initial classification of artefacts in terms of models, constructs, procedures and instantiations, there have been only a few attempts to come up with a more systematic approach. After reviewing previous work, this conceptual paper introduces an ontology of IS artefacts. It starts with an ontological characterization of artefacts and technical objects in general and proceeds to introduce a systematic classification of IS artefacts and compare it with existing work.

	Line 30:   abstract = {From a design science perspective, information systems and their components are viewed as artifacts. However, not much has been written yet on the ontological status of artifacts or their structure. After March & Smith’s (1995) initial classification of artifacts in terms of models, constructs, methods and instantiations, there have been only a few attempts to come up with a more systematic approach. This conceptual paper provides an ontological analysis of the notion of artifact grounded in the foundational ontology UFO. Its core is an ontological characterization of artifacts, and technical objects in general from a Design Science Research perspective, developed in conversation with other approaches. This general artifact ontology is applied in a systematic classification of IS artifacts. We include practical implications for Design Science Research.}

	Line 11: 	abstract     = {The use of object/relational mapping (ORM) frameworks is the state-of-practice in software development, with several ORM frameworks for different object-oriented programming languages. However, to our knowledge, there is no formal definition of the concepts related to these frameworks, which could serve as basis for semantic interoperability tasks (e.g., code migration) or in the definition of architectural smells independently of the chosen framework. In this work, we present ORM-O, a domain reference ontology that aims to identify and represent the semantics of object/relational mapping when such frameworks are used in software development.},

	Line 13: 	abstract     = {Safety-critical systems (SCSs) have become an intrinsic part of human dailylife in multiple domains, such as automotive, avionics, and rail industries. Such systems are not only required to implement the functionality they should provide, but also have to satisfy a set of safety requirements in order to ensure the mitigation of hazardous consequences. It is fundamental that safety requirements are defined based on the results issued from safety analysis. Various studies have asserted that most significant flaws in the safety requirements are related to the omission of hazards and causes associated with the identified hazards in early stages of SCSs development. The main drawbacks of the current practice applied in safety analysis,lie in that: \textbullet{} due to the lack of a common understanding of the hazard concept, the hazards and their causes are typically identified in accordance to the intuition and experience of the analysts and, \textbullet{} analysts are inclined to identify generic causes for a certain hazard description, for example, ``Design flaw, Coding error, and Human error''and, \textbullet{} there is an essential need to formalize the experience of the analysts in a structured way, in order to save effort and, \textbullet{} since traditional safety analysis techniques are usually based on well known system behaviors represented by models, such as automata and sequence diagrams, a new approach is needed when such behavioral models are not available. These considerations motivate us to formulate the following general research question: How can safety analysis, within the context of safety-critical systems, be conducted to reduce the omission of potential hazards and their causes in early stages of the system development life-cycle?

	Line 5: The FAIR Model Catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Research, commonly referred to as **OntoUML/UFO Catalog**, is a structured and open-source catalog that contains OntoUML and UFO ontology models. It was conceived to allow collaborative work and to be easily accessible to all its users.
	Line 7: The goal of the OntoUML/UFO Catalog is to support empirical research in OntoUML and UFO, as well as for the general conceptual modeling area, by providing high-quality curated, structured, and machine-processable data on *why*, *where*, and *how* different modeling approaches are used.
	Line 183: Your contribution is fundamental to the catalog's success. We highly encourage authors to submit their models and tools to this catalog. With that, you will be supporting research in (ontology-driven) conceptual modeling, ontology engineering, software design, and several others.
	Line 211: The list of works that use the data provided by the OntoUML/UFO Catalog to test algorithms and perform other tasks grows over time. Instead of keeping a manual list in this document, we recommend you access its [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3857815022699931555&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364289037_A_FAIR_Model_Catalog_for_Ontology-Driven_Conceptual_Modeling_Research/citations) citation lists to access an updated information.
